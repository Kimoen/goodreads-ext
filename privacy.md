# Privacy Policy – Goodreads Edition Finder

**Effective date:** 14/07/2025

**Goodreads Edition Finder** is a browser extension that helps users identify whether a book on Goodreads is available in their preferred language. We value your privacy and have designed this extension to operate entirely within your browser without collecting or transmitting any personal data.

## What information do we collect?

**None.** This extension does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal information, browsing history, Goodreads account data, or any other identifiable information.

## How does the extension work?

- The extension analyzes the content of Goodreads book pages **locally**, in your browser, to determine the book’s language and whether a translated edition exists.
- Your selected target language (e.g., French, Spanish) is stored using the browser's `storage.sync` feature to remember your preference across sessions. This data never leaves your device unless you're using browser sync features provided by Chrome or Firefox.

## Do we use cookies or trackers?

No. The extension does not use cookies, trackers, analytics, or any third-party scripts.

## Do we share your data?

No. Since we don’t collect any data, there is nothing to share.

## Changes to this policy

If this extension evolves in a way that impacts user privacy, this policy will be updated accordingly. We are committed to transparency.
